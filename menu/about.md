I am a third-year graduate student in UC Davis' Biological Psychology Graduate Group working in the Trainor Lab. My interests lie within the realm of integrative biology, ecology, neuroendocrinology, and female animal behavior. When not in the lab, I spend my time engaging in outreach, hiking, and playing with my cats.

### My Science Journey
From 2014 - 2017 at Palomar Community College, I participated in social justice and student activism regarding many Feminist and Queer issues where I would help host/lead workshops on education of LGBT+ topics, events increasing access to life-necessities like housing and healthcare, and so on. After obtaining my assoiates degree in Psychology, I transferred to CSUSM and joined the Maternal Behavior and Neuroendocrinology lab ran by Dr. Kimberly D'Anna-Hernandez and shortly after I joined our local SACNAS chapter and the NIH-funded prep program MARC*U-STAR. From 2017 - 2020, I competed in university and state-wide science communication contests, I presented my independent research at numberous local and national scientific conferences (SBN, SfN, etc.), and I participated in science education and mentorship of underpriviledged youth in the greater San Deigo area. Since joining UC Davis in 2020, I blah blah blah. Because of my Tiwe/Taos Native/Mexican hertigate, my existence as a queer scientist, and my experiences as a first-generation college student, I am hugely passionate about infusing culture into my science.
