A copy of my CV is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1de5UNqcIgjwox_ZoEKQybjwN9_kJ0Qnm/view?usp=sharing)!
### Science communication is key
I am hugely passionate for providing equal and equitable access to scientific information, and I have a long history of particiating in science communication. Most of this work was done in my hometown through career day events at my old elementary and Community College after I began a career in science in 2017. I have experience teaching children about a range of topics under biology and ecology, as well as preparing and hosting hands-on science crafting booths with Super STEM Saturday. I have also worked with [Skype A Scientist](https://twitter.com/JaceKuske/status/1561837387872776193?s=20) and taught children about their local wildlife and my own research in a manner that was digestable to their grade levels. 
### Mentorship keeps science thriving
Currently, I am the Graduate Student representative for the Post Doctoral and Graduate student chapter of (Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science) SACNAS. I'm also involved in the First Generation Mentorship program and the Psychology department's the Diverse Mentoring Initiative. Scientists from "non-traditional" backgrounds are far too familiar with the difficulties in finding role models in science. I try my best to mentor my own students in a manner that is respectful to their own culture and experiences by meeting the student "where they are". This effort has been recognized by the UC Davis Psychology Department and my own previous mentees. I have participated in numerous events around the Davis campus aimed at giving advice about research, graduate school, and how to navigate primarily White institutions as a non-White student. I primarily work through [SACNAS at Davis](https://gspdsacnasatucd.weebly.com/), but I also work with the Accelerating Success by Providing Intensive Research Experience [ASPIRE](https://aspire.ucdavis.edu/) prepratory program as a co-director and mentor. 
### Passing on the knowledge
Students reaching out to me are more than welcome to ask me about fellowships, prep programs, graduate school, and activism. Anyone may ask for pdf copies of my GRFP materials (personal and research statements).
