In October 2023, I did something that not only kept me in graduate school, but also gave me the second family I needed so far from home. I joined the UC Davis student retention program and cultural group, Danzantes del Alma (DDA), a ballet folklorico (<i>balie folkl√≥rico</i>) group on campus since the 70's. It has been such a fulfulling experience to celebrate my Mexican hertiage in such a fun and beautiful way. I was very hesitant to try it, but I was encouraged by my mentee (who is also a DDA member and student leader) to join. The group has given me so much love and support, so I felt compelled to give back in some way.
