It has been a really great 4th year, mostly because at the start of fall I couldn't envision myself still continuing my PhD. There have been a long list of obsticles, but an even longer list of what kept me here. I am extremely fortunate to have found support in so many people, and will never forget the kindness they showed me when I was at my lowest. Because of this large network uplifting me, I was able to accomplish so much this year!

  In the fall, I attended the National Diversity in STEM conference hosted by the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS). I was honored as a student leader at the Chapter Officer Leadership October Retreat (COLOR) and learned how to better support the Grad SACNAS chapter at UC Davis. I also won a presentation award for best Neuroscience talk!
