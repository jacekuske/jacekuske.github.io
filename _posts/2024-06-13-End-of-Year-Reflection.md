It has been a really great 4th year, mostly because at the start of fall I couldn't envision myself still continuing my PhD. There have been a long list of obsticles, but an even longer list of what kept me here. I am extremely fortunate to have found support in so many people, and will never forget the kindness they showed me when I was at my lowest. Because of this large network uplifting me, I was able to accomplish so much this year!

In the fall, I attended the National Diversity in STEM conference hosted by the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS). I was honored as a student leader at the Chapter Officer Leadership October Retreat (COLOR) and learned how to better support the Grad SACNAS chapter at UC Davis. I also won a presentation award for best Neuroscience talk! I have grown so much as a scientist, a leader, and a person because of SACNAS, and the NDiSTEM conference is always a perfect way to reflect on my time in science. I plan to return in my final year for the Phoenix conference this upcoming fall!

Fall was also the start of my time with Danzantes del Alma, a student retention and ballet folklorico group at Davis that provides academic support and cultural expression through dance! I was encouraged to join by my friend and lab member...who was also the student manager! There are no words to describe how important this group has become to my life here in Davis. I found a space that supports me as a scientist, a Latino, and as a little weirdo with a lot of energy!
